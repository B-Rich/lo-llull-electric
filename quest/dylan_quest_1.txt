A)
Girls’ faces formed the forward path
From phony jealousy
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists
Unthought of, though, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now


B)
You do what you must do and ya do it well, 
I was all around 
The sigh and the thought in the barm far 
And a honey back
In the world on the sun is a star of the black 
To apple wore I was baby, 
She said, "I was a good 
Were the soul you 
And I was the spark 
And blowing for you".  


C)
It said I was walking 
I can't even be fine, 
The pulling for died bone 
The pantal could have merry, 
I want you, baby, you got them and a thing of the can 
The black they can feel me 
I can't stand the shadows and it loves me 
one can do the pale, the far 
I'll ever know that I was your heart 


D)
And tells me of her dreams
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Into the ditch of what each one means
At times I think there are no words
But these to tell what's true


E) 
Fortune calls
I stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace
merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down
She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born
On midsummer's eve, near the tower


F)
There ain't no doubt but one kind.  
She blows, don't make me but the man I got a'rambling 
And the tame everybody 
Some heart is sad 
Every stand in the mountain 


G)
The cat's in the well, the street, the grand 
And it's like the balls and the days of '49 in the mood, 
I had my eyes like a children of the road 
In the tongue to straight pretty 
Love in the lord out of his stars 
And the gettin' like men the country train 
And I said "I was she"
